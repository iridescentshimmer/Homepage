<section>       
<p class="line">You can hear the wind through the trees…
The leaves are all blowing down. Now the road is covered in orange and gold. Little sunsets against the grey.
Some of them blow close to you, but your window keeps them away. It’s locked shut. 
</p>       
<p class="line">Somewhere a generator disagrees.</p>       
<p class="line"> It’s just barely starting to rain. Water slips out of the clouds and plummets to the concrete. The noise won’t make it to you. Clouds all over, but the rain isn’t heavy. Your hands are flat against the glass and it is cold in your palms. Beneath them, on the window sill: rows and rows of paper cranes. They preen against the glass and are beautiful against the drone of it all. Three complete rows are lined neatly; and the fourth, the last row you’ll be able to fit, stretches halfway the width of your window. When you have filled the space with cranes you will crush them all into oblivion and begin again with mice.

<span class="sidenote"> The gleam and the low glow; before you it all is illuminated.</span>       </p>       
<p class="line">Behind you your door is shut tight. When the sky is dark your father will open it and bring in your supper. You are hungry now. You could open the door but you’re not allowed to leave and it would be bad. You rub your fingers together. You step away from the window. The pine trees hold tight against the wind and all the golden leaves shimmer and gleam beneath the cloudlight. Paper crunches beneath your foot, some flower or large mammal you guess by the feel of it. There is paper all around you, piled in your bed, rising up in stacks by your wardrobe, torn and tossed around all over the floor. The grey light from your window illuminates it all and it is all grey and blue and you yourself are grey and blue. You blink in the brightness and rub your eyes move away and you do not change colour.</p>     </section>      <section>
